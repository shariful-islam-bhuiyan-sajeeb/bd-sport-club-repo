                        1. How React Work?
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known
                            as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript
                            functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or
                            props.It's possible to have as many components as necessary
                            without cluttering your code.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <div
                    tabIndex={0}
                    className="collapse collapse-plus border border-base-300  text-white bg-gray-800 rounded-box">
                    <div className="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                        2. what is the Main difference between props and state ?
                    </div>
                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p className="pb-4 border-b">
                            The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data
                            or information about the component and can change over time. The
                            change in state can happen as a response to user action or system
                            event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the
                            behavior of the component and how it will render. A state must be
                            kept as simple as possible. It represents the component's local
                            state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside
                            the or by the component directly.

                            Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the
                            value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML
                            attributes. It allows passing data from one component to other
                            components. It is similar to function arguments and can be passed
                            to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function.
                            Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the
                            component.

                        3. what is exactly useeffect work except api call ?
                    </div>
                    <div className="collapse-content">

                            What does useEffect do?
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do
                            something after render. React will remember the function you
                            passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later
                            after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the
                            document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call
                            some other imperative API
                        </p>
                        <h1 className="md:text-2xl text-xl text-semibold pt-4 mb-2 border-b-2 inline-block">

                        <p>
                            1.The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your
                            components. <br />
                            2.Some examples of side effects are :{" "}
                            <b>fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.</b>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
